A twist to the beloved 4 wins 2-player game.

## How to play
To start the game, follow this link:
https://kricki.rocks/4wins3loses/

If it is your first time, you need to create an account. Just click "Start New Game" and then "Register New Player". Upon creating a new account, you can choose a player from the list and challenge him/her to a match!

## Rules
The rules are simple. It is like 4 wins: If you put 4 of your stones either horizontally, vertically or diagonally before your opponent does so, you win. BUT! If you likewise put 3 stones in a row, you lose.

Then, how can you win? You need to leave gaps. For example, if this is a row of yours:

X X _ X

you could in principle win the game in the next move by closing the gap:

X X X X

However, you also win if your opponent loses first. Therefore, you could also fool your opponent into putting 3 stones in a line - then he/she loses and you win.

## Prerequisites
This is a browser game. It should work in principle on smartphones, however Internet Explorer is not supported and probably never will.
If you find Bugs or have suggestions, I'd be more than happy if you let me know:
